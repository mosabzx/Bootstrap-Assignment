# Bootstrap-Assignment

Bootstrap

This assignment is meant as an introduction to the use of Twitter Bootstrap. You will make the page entirely from scratch, using Bootstrap classes combined with your own CSS rules to style your page.
Required Features:
• A menu bar, fixed to the top of the page containing:

• A logo image (use lorempixel.com or find your own)
• Links to different parts of the website.

• A content section of the page with more than one article in a single line, separated into columns.

• A carousel element containing at least three images.

• A sidebar menu to the main content section, using the Stacked Pills component for the menu items.

• A contact form with fields for name, email-address, telephone number and a message. It should have a button to submit the form (using the “btn-success“ class), and a button to reset the form’s fields (using the “btn-danger” class).

• A footer, fixed to the bottom of the page, with a copyright notice and a link returning you to the top of the page.

Code Requirements:
• Bootstrap must be included, with dependencies.
• A bootstrap theme must be used.

Optional:

• Add one more slide to the carousel, moving the contact form into it.

• Change the list of links in the menu bar to a dropdown.

• Make the menu bar links align to the right side of the page, while the logo and name aligns to the left side of the page.
